 * 🌟 Min-Heap 🌟
 * -----------------
 * ✅ A Min-Heap is a binary tree where:
 *   1️⃣ Every parent node has a smaller value than both of its children.
 *   2️⃣ It must be a Complete Binary Tree (CBT).
 *
 * 🏗️ Complete Binary Tree (CBT):
 *   🔹 All levels except the last are completely filled.
 *   🔹 The last level is filled from left to right.
 *   🔹 Always balanced, so its height is always O(log n).
 *
 * 📌 Given Array: {10, 1, 3, 8, 11, 30, 15, 6}
 *
 *          1
 *         /  \
 *        6    3
 *       / \  / \
 *      8 11 30 15
